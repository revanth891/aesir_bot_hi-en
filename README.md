Hi, I'm Revanth.
This is a chatbot i made from scratch, instead of plagarising wawa sensei's code. I knew if i used the method that wawa sensei used, I would have a lipsync working chatbot ready by now.
But, I chose to create something of my own, building from scratch.
I made this assistant after solving a lot of errors, and no API is fully free.
I tried multiple models from openAI and Deepseek but the only one that i could get to work is GEMINI(with Hindi).
FFMPEG threw a lot of errors when i tried to use it and multiple more Errors!

This has been a great Learning experience and now i have good knowledge on what to do next, I'll be working on Metahumans on UE. That I think has a lot of potential.

I made a metahuman NPC,(chatbot) with convAI and UE5 and that woked very well in terms of latency, It's as fast at an actual GPT unlike the ones made using readyplayer me models.

I solved these errors and tried to do this challenge in a different way than the easier way, just so that i can learn more.
Although I failed in making a 3D chatbot, I'm excited for the future!

Thank You,
