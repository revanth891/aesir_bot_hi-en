Hi, I'm Revanth. This is a chatbot I made from scratch, instead of plagiarizing wawa sensei's code. I knew if i used the method that wawa sensei used, I would have a lip sync working chatbot ready by now. But, I chose to create something of my own, building from scratch. I made this assistant after solving a lot of errors, and no API is fully free. I tried multiple models from openAI and Deepseek but the only one that I could get to work is GEMINI(with Hindi). FFMPEG threw a lot of errors when i tried to use it and multiple more Errors!

This has been a great Learning experience and now I have good knowledge on what to do next, I'll be working on Metahumans on UE. That I think has a lot of potential.

I made a metahuman NPC,(chatbot) with convAI and UE5 and that worked very well in terms of latency, It's as fast as an actual GPT unlike the ones made using readyplayer me models.

I solved these errors and tried to do this challenge in a different way than the easier way, just so that I can learn more. Although I failed in making a 3D chatbot, I'm excited for the future!

I made this in the last 48hrs, due to frequenting hospitals because of Asthma.

Thank You!
